main.dart:
    holds the entry point of the app, inside the void main function.

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
--- main(): The entry point. It tells the app to launch.

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { ... },

--- this is the main entry point of the app
--- MyApp is the root widget

classes are something like the introduction where there is something to build in flutter like another pages.


navigator.push is the function for transitioning to other pages.
